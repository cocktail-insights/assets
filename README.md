# Assets
Static assets for all our projects i.e. logos, jsons, etc

To access assets, use this base url along with the directory path to the file:

```
https://cocktail-insights.github.io/assets
```

# Example

To access the adgeek logo with size 60x60, the link would be:

```
https://cocktail-insights.github.io/assets/adgeek/logo/60x60.png
```

which would look like this: 

![AdGeek Logo](https://cocktail-insights.github.io/assets/adgeek/logo/60x60.png)
